what is git => Free & open Source Version Control System (tools that help to track changes in code )
What is github => website where we host repositories online 
README.md => markdown 

using git =>
command line (most popular)
IDE / code editors(like VSCODE)
Graphica User InterFace (like GItKraken)


Configuring Git (which name and email throw commit and store myself information on github)
git config --global user.name "my name"
git config --global user.email "email@gmail.com"
git config --list 


Basic Commands =>
clone -> Cloning a repository on our local machine (cmd)-> git clone <https-link>
status -> displays the state of the code (cmd )-> git status     

add -> adds new or changed files in your working directory to the git staging area. (cmd ) -> git add <file-name> 
commit -> it is the record of change  (cmd) -> git commit -m"meaning-ful message "
push -> upload local repo content to remote repo (cmd) -> git push origin main (origin ->where git hub repo present / main->branch  )


init -> used to create a new git repo  (cmd) -> git init 
git remote add origin <--ssh-link--->
git remite -v (to verify remote)
git branch (to check current branch )
git branch -M main (to rename branch)
git push -u origin main(set origin u -> upstream on cloud set create by degault) after this use -> git push (only)
git push origin main 

if are u want to add and commit at a time then 
git commit -am "message" (a->add , m->message)


Git branch 
git branch (to check branch )
git branch -M main (to rename branch )
git checkout <-branch-name-> (to navigate one branch to another branch) 
git checkout -b <-new branch name -> (to create new branch)

git branch -d <-branch name-> (to delte branch)

set the origin of the new branch then use 
git push --set-upstream origin branch_name



Mergin Code 

git diff <-branch_name-> (to compare commits,branches , files&MORE)
git merge <-branch_name-> (to merge 2 branches)
OR
 Pull Request ->it lets you tell others about changes you've pushed to a branch in a repository on github(pull request also be a commit)
 create a Pull_request(PR)

#used to fetch and download content from a remote repo and immediately update the local repo to match that content
 pull request only changes on remote system but we need to update on local system the use this 
(cmd)->git pull origin main 


Merge Conflicts =>  An event that takes place when git is unable to automatically resolve differece in code between two commits  
git merge branch_name


Fixing Mistakes ->
Case 1: staged changes 
    git reset <-file-name->(only for one)
    git reset (for all)
Case 2: commited changes (for one commit)    
    git reset HEAD~1
Case 3: Commited changes (for many commits)    
    git log(commit_info)
     git reset <-commit_hash->
     git reset --hard <-commit_hash-> 


    
  what is forking =>   a fork is a new repository that shares code and visibility settings with the origianl "upstream"
  repository 
  Fork is a rough copy.
